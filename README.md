# realtime-obejct-detection-using-key-point-extractors
Can be used for detection of objects in the real time camera feed  uses ORB(Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm for key point extraction
.It then uses a FLANN based matcher to match the key points extracted in real time with the key-points of the image to be detected
